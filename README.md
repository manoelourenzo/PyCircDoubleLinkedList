Circle Double Linked List
This Python implementation provides a Circular Doubly 
Linked List with the following functionalities:

Initialization: Create an empty Circular Doubly Linked List.

isEmpty: Check if the list is empty.

addFirst: Add a new node with the specified item to the beginning of the list.

addLast: Add a new node with the specified item to the end of the list.

removeNode: Remove the first occurrence of a node with the specified item from the list.

showList: Display the items in the Circular Doubly Linked List.

search: Search for the first occurrence of a specified item in the list.

clear: Delete all nodes from the list.

Usage
Import the Node and CircleDoubleLinkedList classes into your Python script or application.
python
Copy code
from your_module import Node, CircleDoubleLinkedList
Create an instance of the CircleDoubleLinkedList class.
python
Copy code
circLinkedList = CircleDoubleLinkedList()
Use the various methods provided by the class to manipulate the Circular Doubly Linked List.
python
Copy code
circLinkedList.addFirst(42)
circLinkedList.addLast(17)
circLinkedList.showList()
circLinkedList.removeNode(42)
circLinkedList.search(17)
circLinkedList.clear()
